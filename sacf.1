.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sacf
is a simple auto cpu frequencer that only changes two things: the
governor and turbo boost state; depending on the cpu load, system load and the
temperature. Made primarly for latops, since laptops could have an AC adapter
or use the battery. It needs root access to write to the system filesystem.
