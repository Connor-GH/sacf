sacf - Simple Auto CPU Frequencer
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBsacf\fP [ \fB-blrtTv\fP ] [ \fB-g\fP \fIgovernor\fP ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
sacf is a simple program that only changes two things: the governor and turbo
boost state; depending on the cpu load, system load and the temperature.
Machines that have a battery and most of the time depend on it are the target,
but since it reduces the power consumption in general it can be beneficial, in
theory.

.PP
It requires root access to write to the pseudofilesystem \fC/sys\fP in order to change
the turbo boost value.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Without any arguments, sacf will run every \fBinterval\fP seconds forever.

.TP
\fB-d, --daemon\fP
daemonize process, forks into the background.
.TP
\fB-g govenor\fP
run once, then exit.
.TP
\fB-r\fP
run once, then exit.
.TP
\fB-T\fP
Disables turbo boost for all cores, then exit.
.TP
\fB-t\fP
Enables turbo boost for all cores, then exit.
.TP
\fB-v\fP
Print the version number and exit.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
sacf is customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source
code. This keeps it simple, since reading a config file isn’t that hard (but
adds unneeded complexity), and in many aspects more customizable. I try my best
to comment about the variables in config.h, since they don’t do anything crazy,
so it should be very straight foward what does what.
.SH "ISSUES"
.PP
BSD’s system support is not ready.
